# Nick meeting Friday

# This script takes the raw data from the SUA Working System ("SUA_waste.csv" - downloaded by Amanda Gordon (ESS)) and does the following: 
 
# 1) Commodities are categorized into commodity groups. I found no directory for item groups, so I copied 
# the item codes from the FAOSTAT Working System and categorized them with loops.  
# In any case, a directory file which links each item to a itemgroups would replace this long procedure... 
 
# 2) Reshape the data from wide to long. Since the whole dataset is too large for my (old) computer I split it 
# into pieces and afterwards I put the reshaped pieces together. A more powerful computer might do it in one shot! 
 
# Explanation of the variables: 
# itemcode ... ID of the item 
# elementcode ... ID of the element: 51 for Production, 61 for Imports, 71 for Stock variation, 91 for Exports 
                # and 121 for Losses				 
# num_x ... quantities of element x (in 1000 metric tons) for given year and country 
# symb_x ... flag of num_x.
